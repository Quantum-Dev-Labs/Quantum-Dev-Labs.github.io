# Summary (3–5 min)

## What this paper is about
Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can involve persistent redness, flushing, visible blood vessels, acne-like bumps, thickened skin changes, and eye symptoms. These can meaningfully affect comfort, confidence, and overall quality of life. Current guidelines help with *starting* and *adjusting* treatment, but many clinicians and patients still lack clear, practical guidance on **long-term control and maintenance**.

This paper summarizes discussions from an international group of experienced dermatologists (“REACH” Global Scientific Committee) and proposes a **streamlined longitudinal pathway** for managing rosacea over time—especially after the initial flare is under control.

## Key idea: treat the *features you have*, not a “type”
The authors emphasize the shift away from older “subtype” labels toward a **phenotype-based approach** (feature-based care). In practice, that means:
- Identify which features are present (e.g., persistent redness, flushing, papules/pustules, telangiectasia, ocular symptoms, thickening).
- Prioritize what bothers the patient most (including “invisible” symptoms like burning/stinging).
- Tailor treatment to the individual’s pattern and severity rather than forcing them into a rigid category.  [oai_citation:2‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

## The REACH “longitudinal pathway” in 4 steps
The paper frames rosacea management as a journey with four recurring steps:

### A) Self-management & entering the medical pathway
At the first visit, the authors recommend spending time on:
- **History + timeline:** when symptoms started, how they fluctuate, what has helped/hurt.
- **Trigger patterns:** common examples include heat, sunlight, stress, alcohol, spicy foods, hormonal changes, and sometimes products/medications (including steroid overuse).
- **Quality of life (QoL):** quick questionnaires can help surface how much rosacea affects daily life and guide priorities.
- **Comorbidities:** the review notes reported associations with several conditions (cardiovascular, GI, autoimmune, neurologic, mood), while also stressing these links are statistical and do not prove causality.  [oai_citation:3‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

**Important nuance:** “Trigger avoidance” should be discussed sensitively—over-restricting life can become a burden in itself. The paper suggests focusing on triggers most clearly tied to flares/exacerbations.

### B) Diagnosis (including harder-to-spot presentations)
The authors highlight that rosacea can be **missed or misdiagnosed**, especially when:
- **Skin of color:** redness can be harder to see; careful history and guideline-based criteria become even more important.
- **Ocular rosacea:** eye involvement is often overlooked; referral to ophthalmology is recommended except in mild cases.
- **Less common variants:** phymatous changes (e.g., rhinophyma), granulomatous rosacea, rare scalp involvement, neurogenic rosacea, and Morbihan’s disease can be challenging and may need specialist expertise.  [oai_citation:4‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

The paper also discusses Demodex mites as an important factor in some patients and notes that biopsies are rarely needed.  [oai_citation:5‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

### C) Treatment selection (set goals + build the foundation)
A major theme is that **skincare is not optional** in rosacea—it’s part of therapy:
- Gentle cleansing
- Minimalist moisturizers to support the barrier
- **Daily sunscreen** (UV is a common trigger; photoprotection is emphasized)
The authors cite expert consensus supporting consistent routines alongside prescriptions.

Then, treatment selection should be guided by:
- What’s available/affordable
- The patient’s main bothersome features
- Preferences (topical vs oral, tolerance, lifestyle)
- Clear goal-setting and realistic expectations (topicals can take weeks; flares can wax and wane)

They also highlight newer topical options that have entered the toolbox for papulopustular rosacea (e.g., micro-encapsulated benzoyl peroxide 5% cream and minocycline 1.5% foam, per FDA support mentioned in the review).  [oai_citation:6‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

### D) Maintenance (stay controlled for longer)
Because rosacea is chronic, the pathway emphasizes **maintenance therapy**—using the *minimum effective* regimen to keep skin “clear or almost clear” and reduce relapse risk.

The review summarizes longer-term evidence (examples include up to ~52 weeks in studies referenced) supporting maintenance for:
- **Ivermectin 1% cream** (papulopustular rosacea): long-term safety/efficacy in extension studies.
- **Oxymetazoline 1% cream** (persistent erythema): 52-week open-label data with low reported rebound rates in the cited trial.
- **Brimonidine gel 0.33%** (erythema): effective but the paper stresses that adverse reactions and potential rebound/worsening should be explained clearly.
- **Sub-antibiotic dose doxycycline 40 mg modified release (SDD40)**: a longer-term study cited suggests reduced relapse when continued after successful initial control.  [oai_citation:7‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

The authors also discuss **combination and multimodal approaches** (e.g., targeting inflammation plus vascular features plus barrier repair), and note that physical therapies (like certain light/laser modalities) may help with redness/telangiectasia and possibly Demodex density—while emphasizing experienced clinician selection, especially for darker skin phototypes.  [oai_citation:8‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

## What this means in plain language
- Think of rosacea as **long-term management**, not a one-time fix.
- **Foundational skincare + sunscreen** is a core part of treatment, not just “nice to have.”
- Treatment works best when it targets **your specific features** (redness, flushing, bumps, eye symptoms, etc.).
- After improvement, a **maintenance plan** can help extend remission and reduce “two steps forward, one step back” cycles.
- Communication matters: understanding expectations, triggers, and QoL can improve outcomes and help patients feel more in control.  [oai_citation:9‡s13555-025-01612-x.pdf](sediment://file_00000000d92c71f5b1dd27d61a88e95f)

## Limitations and transparency
- This is **not a systematic review**; it’s a targeted literature search plus expert consensus and clinical experience.
- Some recommendations rely on real-world experience where long-term trial data are limited.
- The project was **initiated and funded by Galderma**, and the paper includes extensive conflict-of-interest disclosures; that doesn’t invalidate the content, but it’s important context when interpreting emphasis on certain therapies.
