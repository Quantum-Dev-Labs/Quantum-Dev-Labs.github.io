    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Quantum Dev Labs built the <strong>Rosacea Diary</strong> app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by Quantum Dev Labs and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <p>This page informs users regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for those who use the Service.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The personal information we collect is used solely for providing and improving the Service. We do not use or share your information except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise defined here.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Rosacea Diary stores most of your personal data locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account using Apple’s <strong>CloudKit</strong> technology. This allows your data to sync across your devices via iCloud. However, this data remains private to you—Quantum Dev Labs and its team members have no access to your CloudKit data.</p>
    <p>The app also uses third-party services for analytics and crash reporting. These services may collect limited technical information, such as device identifiers, crash logs, and usage data. These services include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Quantum Dev Labs only receives anonymized, aggregated reports from these services to help us improve app performance and stability.</p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>In case of an app error, diagnostic data (Log Data) may be collected automatically by third-party services. This data may include information such as your device’s IP address, device name, operating system version, app settings, time and date of use, and other technical statistics.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>These third parties may have access to certain personal information strictly for the purpose of performing their tasks. They are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing your information. We use commercially reasonable measures to protect it. However, please note that no method of data transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
